## A solution meant to give nutrition and dietery information to control spread of NCDs

Every year, many young children in Kenya die after falling ill because 
they receive medical treatment too late or not at all. Leading causes of 
death among children under five, such as diarrhea and pneumonia, can 
easily be prevented and treated with early and simple interventions at 
home and in the community. Children and adolescents are also key to an 
effective response to the growing burden of non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs), such as diabetes and asthma, which account for almost 100,000 
deaths each year. Not only do a significant number of children and 
adolescents die from NCDs, but the majority of the behaviors that cause 
NCDs start during adolescence. Youth are central to the local changes 
needed for a healthy global future. How can we get people aware of 
proper nutrition needs to reduce lifestyle and Non Communicable Diseases
